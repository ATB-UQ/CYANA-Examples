# CYANA-Examples
Example use of ATB CYANA library files for a tripeptide containing a non-canonical amino acid with an aliphatic ring

Files must be located in the same file when CYANA starts

  - Example.cya
      - Structure calculation file
      - Distance constraints in the form of restraints.upl and .lol form the covalent bond   
     
  - Example.lib
      - Residue library file generated from the ATB 
      - Non-canonical amino acid code JQ5N

  - Example.seq
      - Sequence file
      - Calling ncAA amino acid code JQ5N in position 2
      - Includes link statement to eliminate steric repulsion between covalently bound atoms

  - init.cya
      - Initialisation file
      - Use command 'read lib./Example.lib append' to append residue library file Example.lib to the standard CYANA library file 
      - Use command 'restraints' to call the restraints.cya file to generate restraints.upl and .lol files

  - restraints.cya
      - Generated by the CYLIB command for non-canonical amino acids containing a aliphatic rings that are broken to comply with torsion angle dynamics 
      - The command 'write upl/lol restraint.upl / .lol' generates the appropriate .upl and .lol files for distance restraints

Non-standard amino acid library file and restraints.cya file were accessed from the ATB https://atb.uq.edu.au/molecule.py?molid=703123
