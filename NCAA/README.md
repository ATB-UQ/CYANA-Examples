# CYANA-Examples
Example use of ATB CYANA library files for a non-canonical amino acid containing tripeptide 
Files must be located in the same file when CYANA starts

  - Example.cya
      - Structure calculation file
     
  - Example.lib
      - Residue library file generated from the ATB 
      - Non-canonical amino acid code UT9Y

  - Example.seq
      - Sequence file
      - Calling ncAA amino acid code UT9Y in position 2

  - init.cya
      - Initialisation file
      - Use command 'ead lib./Example.lib append' to append residue library file Example.lib to the standard CYANA library file
